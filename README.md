This project was implemented as a part of an assignment of an unit called 'Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing'. 

(i) This was a group assignment and I achieved the highest grade in the university. We were given a case study and an operational database. 

(ii) I cleaned the data errors (data cleaning) and developed a star schema according to the business requirements.

(iii) Moreover, I was also responsible for writing OLAP queries to provide better insights to the business department.

(iv) In the end, we used Tableau to produce the business intelligence reports.
